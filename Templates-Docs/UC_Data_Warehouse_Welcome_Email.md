## Brief outline to guide initial exploratory/on-boarding conversation with PI

Start by discussing the investigator’s expectations and goals for using UCHDW

Hi,

Thanks for reaching out! It’s great to hear you’re interested in using the UC Health Data Warehouse (UCHDW). Dr. Bell and I are here to guide you through the access process.

### Key Requirement:

The primary user must be proficient in SQL and familiar with the OMOP Common Data Model (CDM). If you don’t have this expertise, consider adding someone to your team who does.

Could you please share your experience with SQL and OMOP?

### About UCHDW/Databricks:

- The platform uses Microsoft Databricks with data organized in an MSSQL server database.
- You create notebooks/workbooks to query data into staging tables using SQL, then analyze with R, Python, or Scala.
- You’ll have flexible, self-paced access with templates and documentation provided.
- Team members who work with data will each need access; resources can be shared within your team.
- Data covers limited datasets from all UC sites (UCD, UCI, UCLA, UCSD, UCSF, UCR).
- Data is de-identified, stored in OMOP CDM v5.3, including diagnoses, encounters, labs, meds, vitals, and other structured data (no notes or imaging).
- You can upload your own files and must perform analysis within UCHDW; only summary data can be exported.

### Access Process:

Once we confirm UCHDW fits your needs, we’ll help initiate access for your technical team.

---

### FAQs:

- No need for a PI at each UC site unless you plan to extract local EHR data.
- IRB approval is not required.
- Multiple users can share the same workspace.
